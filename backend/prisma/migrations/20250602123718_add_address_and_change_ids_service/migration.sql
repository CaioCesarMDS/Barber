  Warnings:

  - You are about to drop the column `address` on the `Barbershop` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - The primary key for the `NoSchedulingService` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `NoSchedulingService` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `SchedulingService` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `SchedulingService` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `_BarberServicesToNoSchedulingService` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The primary key for the `_BarberServicesToSchedulingService` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[addressId]` on the table `Barbershop` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - Added the required column `addressId` to the `Barbershop` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Changed the type of `B` on the `_BarberServicesToNoSchedulingService` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `B` on the `_BarberServicesToSchedulingService` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
